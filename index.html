            <b>1953</b> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf of wheat with a

            can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says GM crops are
            not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
            plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
            acience, people were selecting the best breeds."
